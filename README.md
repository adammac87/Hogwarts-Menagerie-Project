__TO RUN___

Hi there! I hope you are excited to see the first ever solo project I did!
This is the Hogwarts Keeper site. I is a spin on a vet/pet management system
and was completed after my first 4 weeks of CodeClan.
The brief was to have an app that could perform crud function, have persistent
data, and allow pets to be assigned to vets. It could only be made using:

*HTML*<br>
*CSS*<br>
*PYTHON*<br>
*POSTGRESQL*<br>
*FLASK*

I added the extension of giving the user the functionality of searching the database for both pets and vets and checking pets in and out.

So lets get to it and run this! 

Step 1:
Clone the repository onto your system

Step 2:
Navigate to the folder and CD into it. Once there its a good idea to drop the db with the command dropdb vets.

Step 3:
You may have to create it again. type in createdb vets.

Step 4:
Type in the follow to run the database.
psql -d vets -f db/vets.sql in terminal

Step 5:
After that you should be able to type in run console.py in terminal to get it started.

Step 6:
You will then need to make sure flask is running - Flask run in terminal (Its probably best run in new terminal)

Step7:
Paste http://127.0.0.1:4999 into your browser

Step8:
Voila! I hope you enjoy. I had alot of fun doing this and it was the first time in a long time I got to really flex my creative muscles and stretch my abilities and learning. Looking back its basic, but it is the beginning of my life long journey into software development and for that reason I am very proud of it.
